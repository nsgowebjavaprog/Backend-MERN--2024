To understand how npm manages dependencies and related concepts, here are the key points:
Dependency Model and Tree Structure
npm installs dependencies in a tree-like structure, where each package can have its own set of dependencies. This is different from other package managers that might force all packages to share the same canonical set of dependencies.
For example, if two packages foo and bar both depend on different versions of the hello package, npm will install both versions separately:
text
node_modules/
├── foo/
│   └── node_modules/
│       ├── hello/ (version ^0.1.2)
│       └── world/
└── bar/
    └── node_modules/
        ├── hello/ (version ^0.2.8)
        └── goodbye/

This structure ensures that each package has its own set of dependencies, avoiding conflicts between different versions of the same package[1].
Dependency Types
npm supports different types of dependencies:
Dependencies: Listed under the "dependencies" key in the package.json file. These are the packages that your project directly depends on.
json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongodb": "^3.6.4"
  }
}

These dependencies are installed when you run npm install and are saved in the node_modules directory[2][4].
Peer Dependencies: Listed under the "peerDependencies" key in the package.json file. These dependencies are expected to be provided by the dependent package itself, rather than being installed as a separate copy.
json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2"
  }
}

Peer dependencies are not automatically installed by npm unless the dependent package explicitly depends on them. This ensures that there is only one canonical version of the peer dependency used across all dependent packages[1].
DevDependencies: Listed under the "devDependencies" key in the package.json file. These are packages that are only needed for development and testing, not for production.
json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^27.5.1",
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0"
  }
}

These dependencies are installed when you run npm install but are not included in the production build[2][4].
Managing Dependencies
Installing Dependencies: Dependencies are installed using the npm install command. You can specify the package name and version range, and npm will resolve and install the dependencies according to the semantic versioning scheme.
bash
npm install express@^4.17.1

npm also uses the package-lock.json file to lock the exact versions of dependencies installed, ensuring reproducibility across different environments[2][4].
Updating Dependencies: You can update dependencies using the npm update command. This command updates the dependencies to the latest version that satisfies the version range specified in the package.json file.
bash
npm update

For more precise control, you can use npm outdated to check for outdated dependencies and npm install <package>@latest to update a specific package to its latest version[3].
Auditing Dependencies: npm provides the npm audit command to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in the installed dependencies. This feature was introduced in npm version 6 and uses data from the Node Security Platform (NSP)[4].
Best Practices
Review Package Details: Before installing a package, it's a good practice to review its details using npm view <package-name>. This command provides information about the package's version, license, dependencies, and more[3].
Track Unused Dependencies: Use tools like npm-check to identify and remove unused dependencies. This helps in maintaining a clean and efficient dependency tree.
bash
npm install -g npm-check
npm-check

This command shows which dependencies are not used in the codebase and which are missing from the package.json file[3].
Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date: Regularly update dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches and features. Use npm outdated and npm update to manage this process[3].
Analyze and Optimize Dependencies: Analyze the size and usage of dependencies in your node_modules folder. Tools like yarn why <packagename> can help explain why a package is included in your dependency tree. Remove unused dependencies and align on a single package for a well-defined purpose to optimize your dependency management[5].
By following these practices and understanding the dependency model of npm, you can effectively manage dependencies in your Node.js projects, ensuring they are efficient, secure, and well-maintained.
