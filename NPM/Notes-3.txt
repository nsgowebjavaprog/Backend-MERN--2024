Key Features and Uses
Package Management: npm helps developers install, update, and manage dependencies for their projects. It ensures that all dependencies are correctly installed and version-managed[4][5].
Dependency Management: npm manages dependencies listed in the package.json file. It ensures that the correct versions of dependencies are installed and used in the project[4][5].
Security Audits: Modern versions of npm perform security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the dependencies. Users can run npm audit to find vulnerabilities and npm audit fix to resolve them[3][5].
Version Management: npm allows developers to manage multiple versions of code and dependencies. This is crucial for maintaining compatibility and ensuring that updates do not break existing functionality[5].
Publishing Packages: Developers can publish their own packages to the npm registry. This involves creating a package.json file and using the npm publish command to upload the package[1][4].
Private Packages: npm supports private packages, which can be shared within organizations or teams without making them publicly available. This requires an upgraded account or the use of private package registries like GitHub Packages[5].
